LMAO, you're probally never going to NEED this. This is just one of my school projects, and I'd like to publish it as my first programm I did on GitHub. The name is inspired by the first chess bot called: DeepBlue. But before finishing this project the chinese AI DeepSeek was introduced, which helped quite a lot with the code. (my coding skills are really bad). So anyways if you wan't to use this programm you are gonna need python lol. More intruction are in the "help" tab of the programm. CYA
